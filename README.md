My simple raycaster engine written in C.

# TODO

    - Add GUI
    - Add a gun to kill enemies
    - Ability to move between "floors" (maps)
    - Add enemies, other entities (pick-ups) as sprites
    - Create a couple of levels (maximum five)
    - Some final boss?
    - Congratulation screen for the player
